This is my collection of Lyntin scripts for use on the 
[Wheel of Time MUD](http://wotmud.org).

## Instructions

1. First cd to your lyntin datadir (substitute wherever you have it set to):  
   `cd ~/lyntin`

2. Clone the scripts repo into a scripts directory:  
   `git clone https://github.com/rascul/lyntin-scripts scripts`

3. Fire up lyntin.

4. Now all you have to do is read in the scripts you want:  
   `#read scripts/bag`

## Scripts

Here's a listing of the various scripts

*  [bag](bag)  
   Some aliases to make handling of your bag easier.

*  [target](target)  
   A targetting script.

*  [water](water)
